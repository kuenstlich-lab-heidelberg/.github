## Mission Statement 
Künstlich Lab Heidelberg is intended as a collaborative space where human creativity and artificial intelligence intersect to inspire, educate, and innovate with the help of art. We plan an open space where artists and (technical) domain experts come together to collaborate, explore, and visualize the future. Through art, we communicate both the groundbreaking opportunities and the challenges that AI presents for human mankind. Our goal is to foster a deeper understanding of rapidly evolving technologies, sparking innovation and inspiring thoughtful dialogue about the future of our society.
## Motivation
AI technologies are advancing at an unprecedented pace, and today mainly (AI) experts try to understand their full potential and impact. For much of society, it is difficult to imagine or foresee the profound effects these technologies may have in the near future. In some cases, there is even active resistance due to misconceptions, lack of knowledge, or unconscious fear. We believe that art offers a powerful way to bridge this gap, creating a space for dialogue, reflection, and open exploration of AI’s possibilities and challenges.
## Objectives
Künstlich Lab Heidelberg aims to establish a physical space with an open and flexible structure, attracting artists and AI experts to collaborate on innovative projects with tangible, impactful outcomes. Alongside this, a virtual platform will showcase the Lab's collaborative work and project progress, extending its reach.
Our mission is to fuse art and AI technologies to create interactive, sensory, and thought-provoking works. These efforts will be celebrated annually through a local art exhibition, offering the public a chance to engage with the projects. Additionally, the Lab will offer AI inspiration sessions for schools and other interested groups, promoting curiosity and fostering innovation.
In terms of networking, we plan to collaborate with Kreativwirtschaft Heidelberg and Heidelberg University, connecting with departments such as physics, mathematics, biology, and philosophy to involve students with domain expertise. We also intend to engage with the Freie Kunstakademie Mannheim to attract artists, and work with local schools to explore AI-driven educational formats. Synergies will be explored with heidelberg.ai, Heidelberg Innovation Park, and the local start-up scene. Collaborations with ZKM Karlsruhe and the local maker community will enhance our interdisciplinary approach, while larger projects will benefit from the facilities at CoMakingSpace.
